- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Code-acus
- Iâ€™m interested in ... all sorts of things. I am a computer science student - finishing my last year in college and then plan to apply to graduate schools to work on Masters degree in AI, computational abstraction and theory, machine learning, or another adavanced field in computer science all while continuing to work full time as a software develper or coomputer programmer
- Iâ€™m currently learning ... many things including advanced AI, Advanced database engineering in PostgreSQL, algorithms and data structures II, discrete mathematics II, advanced Java programming, advanced C++ as I near the end of my scholastic undergrad journey in Computer Science and Math
---- To graduate the program I will be required to write a "live" programm (application) that will ustilize everything I have learbed incuding AI, Data Structures and Algorthms, Databases, Computer Language of my choice: Java 1 and 2, C++, or Python, and more. This will cuminate in realprgram that must be packaged and delivered, have training materials, and will be required to have software engineering princiles applied including a design document that must include UML along with a mock website that will showcase thehighlights of my project. 
- â€™m looking to collaborate on ... anything comuter sceince related in programming C++ or Java application that piques my interest 
- How to reach me ... reach me through my website at qudrisphere.com, LinkedIn, Facebook, or email at harrisonrogers.two@gmail.com
